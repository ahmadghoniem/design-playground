  const pageInstructions = `This is a page component (\`page.tsx\`). Examine its structure carefully:

**CRITICAL — server-only exports break the build:**
Before importing ANY \`page.tsx\` file, check whether it exports \`metadata\`, \`dynamic\`, \`revalidate\`, \`generateStaticParams\`, \`generateMetadata\`, or other Next.js route-segment config values. These are **server-only exports** and CANNOT be imported into the client component tree (registry.tsx is a client module). Importing such a file will cause a build error like: "You are attempting to export 'metadata' from a component marked with 'use client'".

**If the page has ANY server-only exports OR uses server-only features** (async component, \`cookies()\`, \`headers()\`, database queries, \`getSupabaseClient()\`, \`fetch\` with \`cache\`), you MUST do one of:
- Find the client-side presentational component it delegates to and register that instead
- If there is no client component to delegate to (the page renders inline JSX with server data), **skip this component** — update discovery.json to set status to \`"added"\` with a note, but do NOT add it to registry.tsx. Instead, print: "SKIPPED: [component name] — server-only page with no client presentational component."

For pages that CAN be safely imported:
1. **If the page imports and renders a SINGLE primary UI component** (e.g. \`<InsightsClient />\`), register that imported component directly — use its actual import path.
2. **If the page renders MULTIPLE components or significant inline JSX** and has NO server-only exports, register the page's default export.
3. **If the page re-exports or wraps a client component with minimal additions**, register the client component directly.`;

  const componentInstructions = `This is a standalone component. Register it directly using its actual import path.

If it uses server-only features, find the underlying presentational component and register that instead.`;

  const snapshotSection = propsSnapshot
    ? `## Real data snapshot — use this for mock props

The following is live data fetched directly from this app's data source.
**Use these exact values** when writing the mock props. Do NOT copy any fetch logic — just inline the data as constants.

    : '';

  return `You are adding a component to the design playground. Follow each step exactly.

## Component to register

- **Name**: ${name}
- **Path**: ${componentPath}
- **Type**: ${type}

## Step 1: Determine what to register

${type === 'page' ? pageInstructions : componentInstructions}

${snapshotSection}## Step 2: Create the mock data file

Create a file at: \`${playgroundDir}/data/${mockDataFilename}\`

Requirements:
- Export a single \`mockData\` const containing every prop needed to render the component
- All values must be realistic (real names, real-looking dates, plausible copy — NOT "Lorem ipsum" or "test123")
- Pure serialisable data only — no imports, no functions
- Include any enum/variant props (e.g. \`variant: 'expanded'\`) needed for the ideal default preview

\`\`\`ts
/**
 * Mock data for the ${name} component.
 * Auto-populated by the playground discovery flow — edit freely.
 */

export const mockData = {
  // spread all props the component needs
};
\`\`\`

## Step 3: Add an entry to registry.tsx

Open \`${playgroundDir}/registry.tsx\` and make two edits.

First, determine the **registry ID** and **camelCase variable name** for this component:
- The registry \`id\` MUST be the PascalCase name of the React component you are registering, converted to kebab-case.
  - Examples: \`Team\` → \`team\`, \`ArticleCard\` → \`article-card\`, \`InsightsClient\` → \`insights-client\`
  - Do NOT use the page/route name (e.g. do NOT use \`team-page\` or \`insights-page\`)
- The camelCase variable name is the same conversion in camelCase: \`team\`, \`articleCard\`, \`insightsClient\`

### 3a — add the import at the top (alongside the other mock data imports)

\`\`\`ts
import { mockData as <camelCaseName>MockData } from './data/${mockDataFilename.replace('.ts', '')}';
\`\`\`

Also add a static import for the component itself (alongside the other component imports near the top of the file):

\`\`\`ts
// for a default-exported component (pages, standalone components):
import <ComponentName> from '<correct import path>';

// for a named-exported component:
import { <ComponentName> } from '<correct import path>';
\`\`\`

### 3b — add the entry inside the \`pages\` group's \`children\` array

\`\`\`ts
{
  id: '<kebab-case component name — e.g. team, article-card, insights-client>',
  label: '${name}',
  Component: <ComponentName> as unknown as ComponentType<Record<string, unknown>>,
  props: <camelCaseName>MockData as Record<string, unknown>,
  sourcePath: '<path to the actual component file being registered>',
  size: '<one of: default | laptop | tablet | mobile>',
  propsInterface: \`<the component's TypeScript props interface as a string>\`,${parentId ? `\n  parentId: '${parentId}',` : ''}
},
\`\`\`

**ID rule (critical):** The \`id\` must match the component name in kebab-case, not the discovery entry ID (\`${id}\`). The iteration system uses this ID to link generated variants back to the registry.

Size guidelines:
- \`laptop\` — full-page layouts, dashboards, landing pages
- \`default\` — cards, sections, small/medium components
- \`tablet\` / \`mobile\` — only if the component targets that specific viewport

**Background colour (important):** Some page components may have no explicit background — they inherit \`bg-background\` from the \`<body>\`. In the playground the component is rendered inside a wrapper, NOT a \`<body>\`, so that inheritance is lost. If the component or any of its children rely on the page background colour (e.g. the outermost \`<div>\` has no \`bg-*\` class), add \`className="bg-background"\` to the component's root element in the mock data or note that the playground wrapper already applies \`bg-background\`. Do NOT use a hardcoded \`bg-white\` — always use \`bg-background\` so the correct theme colour is resolved via CSS variables.

## Step 4: Add a props fetcher (if the component uses real data)

Open \`${playgroundDir}/lib/props-fetchers.server.ts\`.

Examine the component at \`${componentPath}\` and its data-fetching logic (look at the page's \`fetch\`/\`async\` calls, server actions, database queries, or API calls it delegates to):

- **If the component fetches real data** (from a database, API, CMS, etc.), add an async fetcher entry to the \`propsFetchers\` map. The key must be the same **kebab-case registry ID** you used in Step 3 (e.g. \`'article-card'\`, \`'team'\`).
  - Mirror the real data-fetching logic from the source component/page — same imports, same client, same query.
  - Return the data shaped exactly like the props the component expects (same structure as the mock data you wrote in Step 2).
  - Keep the snapshot small: use \`.limit()\`, \`.slice()\`, or similar to cap lists to 5–10 items.
  - Only import what the host app already has (e.g. its existing DB client, fetch helpers, etc.). Do NOT add new dependencies.
  - Add any required imports at the top of the file (alongside existing imports).

- **If the component is purely static** (no data fetching — it only uses props, hardcoded values, or context), skip this step entirely.

Example entry shape:

\`\`\`ts
'registry-id': async () => {
  // use the host app's existing data client / fetch helpers
  const data = await fetchSomething();
  return { propA: data.x, propB: data.y };
},
\`\`\`

## Step 5: Update discovery.json

Read \`${playgroundDir}/discovery.json\` and update the entry with id \`${id}\`:

1. Set \`"status"\` to \`"added"\`
2. Add an \`"analysis"\` object:

\`\`\`json
{
  "analysis": {
    "showcasePath": "<path to the component file being registered>",
    "componentName": "<PascalCase React component name, e.g. Team, ArticleCard, InsightsClient>",
    "registryId": "<same kebab-case id used in registry.tsx, e.g. team, article-card, insights-client>",
    "propsInterface": "<TypeScript props interface as a string>",
    "size": "<default | laptop | tablet | mobile>"
  }
}
\`\`\`

**Important:** Do NOT modify the \`parentId\` field if it already exists on this entry — it was set automatically by the system.

## Rules

- Do NOT modify the original component at \`${componentPath}\`
- Do NOT create any wrapper or \`discovered/\` files — there is no \`discovered/\` directory
- Only touch: \`${playgroundDir}/data/${mockDataFilename}\`, \`${playgroundDir}/registry.tsx\`, \`${playgroundDir}/discovery.json\`, and (if the component fetches data) \`${playgroundDir}/lib/props-fetchers.server.ts\`
- All import paths must be correct relative to the project root (\`@/\` alias maps to \`src/\`)
- Mock data must look visually appealing and realistic when rendered
- The props fetcher key MUST match the kebab-case registry ID exactly — this is how the analyze route links the two
